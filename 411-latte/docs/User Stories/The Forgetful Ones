As someone who keeps on forgetting passwords and login information, I’m not Latte allows me to recover my account easily. I can log in to my
account with my password and username. However, I always make tiny mistakes with the entries. The app will prompt me to enter my password 
and username again. I can easily recover my login information with this app. Sometimes, I also forget the correct spelling of a special drink. 
In this app, I can search for the coffee names on the website in the search bar in order to find the coffee I need. If the spelling has 
mistakes, the result should find the closest possible name or it will show “we cannot find the item you are looking for”.
