As a person who is not satisfied with black coffee and wants to find fancy favors, the comparisons between different brands, stores,
and types of coffee are important. In this app, the user can get the information simultaneously from Grubhub, Google, Yelp, and similar 
apps. When the user is hard choosing coffee, the star scores from the different apps can help to make the decision by quickly comparing
the same type of coffee from different places. In this web app, I can quickly find a mixed combination of drinks that i have never heard 
before in coffee places I’ve never heard of, let alone been. I’m excited to play around with it and see what more features it has to offer.
