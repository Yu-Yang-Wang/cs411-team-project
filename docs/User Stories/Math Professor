As a math professor at Boston University, my demand for high-quality, readily-made coffee has always been a difficult desire to satiate, 
especially when I teach three 8-am classes per week. I do have the option to make my own coffee at home, but it's way too time-consuming
and I cannot wake up that early, that consistently. What I look for in a coffee is high-quality, not a regular, overly-saturated, 
substance-lacking commercialized drink. I stumbled on the website called I’m Not Latte and immediately, I was intrigued. As someone who 
doesn’t want to look at something too complicated on a computer, this is it: clean design with a large search bar that includes a 
dropdown of options, most of which I set to default, except for the “highest-rating” option. I search for my favorite black coffee and
got exactly what I wanted. I quickly placed my coffee order for a pickup and went on with my day.
