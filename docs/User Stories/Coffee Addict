As a heavy coffee drinker, I value the taste of coffee. I prefer speed over taste. I also like to use online food ordering apps to redeem 
vouchers and try out different flavors. To me, I’m not Latte is a perfect platform to order my coffee. This app allows me to log in using
my GrubHub account where it can have immediate access to all my personal information. I’m not Latte also shows me the estimated pick-up 
time. I can plan my schedule ahead of time to get my coffee before the start of my classes. The app helps me to track the status of the
order such as “ waiting to be prepared “or “the order is ready for pickup”. The app shows the working hours of the coffee shop so I can
even find a midnight coffee shop when I’m trying to survive all-nighters.
